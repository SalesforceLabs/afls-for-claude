# Field Email Fragment Tracking - Winter '27 (264)

## What's New

Field Email now records exactly which email fragments were selected by the end user when an email is sent. Previously the system stored the email and the template, but not the exact fragment subset chosen at send time. Fragment usage is now stored in a new transaction-grain entity, **Life Science Email Fragment**: each successful send records one row per (Email, Fragment), including the fragment version-at-send. History stays accurate even if templates or fragments are edited later.

**Use case:** A sales rep sends a planned email to an HCP using an approved template and a selected set of fragments. Later, a reviewer opens that send transaction and retrieves the exact fragments and their version-at-send, even though the template has since been revised.

## Admin Setup & Configuration

1. **Enable tracking:** Admin Console > Email > Email Settings > Tracking Settings > check **Track email fragment usage**. (Tracking Settings also contains Days to Track Status, Days to Keep Sent Emails, Days to Check History, and Status Tracking Batch Size.)
2. **Mobile (iPad) sync:** Admin Console > Mobile > Object Metadata Cache Configuration (DB Schema):
   - Add a record for **LifeScienceEmailFragment** (Name shown in the deck: `DbSchema_LifeSciEmailFragment`; Is Active checked; Type: Object; Delta Sync Date Field: Last Modified Date; profile e.g. Field Sales Representative) with SOQL Filter Condition `CreatedDate = TOMORROW`.
   - Edit the existing record for **LifeSciEmailTmplFragment** and set **Attachment Download Method** to `cache`.

## End-User Flow

- iPad: on the Send Email screen, the rep opens **Add Fragments** (searchable list with Fragment Name and Description, min/max selection, All / Selected toggle) and saves the selection. On a successful send, the selected fragments are recorded.
- The deck's iPad demo slide was a placeholder (no demo content).

## Data Model

- New entity: **Life Science Email Fragment** (object reference in the deck: `LifeScienceEmailFragment`), child of Life Science Email (one row per Email and Fragment), with a link to Content Version.
- Related existing entities in the diagram: Life Science Email, Life Science Email Template, Life Science Email Template Fragment (`LifeSciEmailTmplFragment`), Life Science Email Template Related Fragment, Life Science Email Template Snapshot, Content Document / Content Document Link / Content Version.

## Limitations/Gotchas

- Tracking only applies when **Track email fragment usage** is enabled.
- iPad visibility requires the DB Schema record for `LifeScienceEmailFragment` and the `cache` attachment download setting on `LifeSciEmailTmplFragment`, followed by mobile metadata cache regeneration (standard practice).
- Exact field API names on the new entity were not given in the deck; use `describe_sobject` to confirm.
