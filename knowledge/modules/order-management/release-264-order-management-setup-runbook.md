# Order Management Setup Runbook and Troubleshooting - Winter '27 (264)

Practitioner-verified field notes from setting up Order Management in a 264 (package v264.x) org, API 67.0. Org-specific IDs, usernames, and record Ids are intentionally omitted. See [admin setup](./release-264-quoted-orders-admin-setup.md) and [pricing](./release-264-pricing.md) for the feature detail.

## Repeat Runbook (new org)
1. **Confirm licensing**: Life Sciences Cloud for Customer Engagement plus Revenue Cloud Advanced PSLs (check with list_permission_sets); retrieve Settings:Quote, Settings:Order, Settings:RevenueManagement. Signal that Revenue Cloud Advanced is not enabled: `enableCoreCPQ=false` on Settings:RevenueManagement.
2. **Run the Salesforce Go "Customer Engagement - Order Management" checklist (UI only)**. It should create the "Price and Tax Calculation for Quoting" permission set and the pricing procedure/recipe. Checklist items: Revenue Cloud, Context Service, Salesforce Pricing, Price Waterfall, Transaction Pricing, Quote Capture, Standard Price Book, Quote record page activation, Sales Transaction Type.
3. **Admin permission sets**: Context Service Admin + Runtime, Life Sciences Commercial Admin, Life Sciences Core, Product Catalog Management Designer + Viewer, Salesforce Pricing Admin.
4. **Rep permission sets**: Price and Tax Calculation for Quoting, Product Catalog Management Viewer, Document Builder User, Salesforce Pricing Run Time User, Life Sciences Field Sales Representative.
5. **Data**: Quote-enabled Account record type + territories; Product2 + Product Selling Model; Product Catalog / Assortments; Product Territory Availability with Purpose = Quote; **Standard price book entries first, then the custom LS price book entries**; Price Adjustment Tiers.
6. **Admin Console**: Orders and Pricing Settings (pricing procedure, waterfall statuses, product views); activate flows; build the Quote Document Template; check FLS.
7. **Generate the mobile metadata cache**, sync the iPad, and run Visit > Quoted Orders as the rep.

## What is UI/Go only (not scriptable via the API/tools used)
Salesforce Go checklist; pricing recipe, pricing procedure, and extended context definition; Quote Document Template (Document Builder, Life Sciences Digital Signature, Compliance Statement Definition); Admin Console Orders and Pricing Settings (no matching category appeared in list_admin_settings in the test org, which had 46 categories; create_admin_setting was not attempted); flow activation (Browse Product Catalog, Discover Products, LSC Validate Mandatory Quote Fields).

## Verified Behaviors and Gotchas
- Objects present in a 264 org: Quote, QuoteLineItem, QuoteDocument, Assortment, PriceAdjustmentSchedule/Tier, ProductCatalog, ProductSellingModel, ProductTerritoryAvailability, ComplianceStatementDef, DigitalSignature.
- Existing Product Territory Availability rows seen defaulted to Purpose = Visit; none with Purpose = Quote, so quote availability must be created.
- Pre-existing Revenue Cloud sample data (B2B/D2C catalogs, selling models, price adjustment schedules) may be present and is not LSC data; do not assume it serves Life Sciences products.
- The "Price and Tax Calculation for Quoting" permission set may not exist (no PS, PSL, or group) until Revenue Cloud / Salesforce Go enablement creates it; the rep cannot be assigned it before then.
- `list_trigger_handlers` errored ("sObject type 'LifeScienceTriggerHandler' is not supported") in this org; the deck has no trigger-handler step for Order Management, so it is not needed.
- Retrieving Settings:ContextService / Pricing / ProductCatalog returns "Settings type ... is unknown"; these are not metadata settings types (harmless).
- `sf` retrieves can take about 2.5 minutes; run them in the background.

## Errors and Fixes
| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| assign_permission_set with API-style name `lsc4ce__LifeSciencesCore` returns "Permission Set Not Found" | Use the label: "Life Sciences Core" |
| SOQL on PermissionSetGroup `Name`: "No such column 'Name'" | Use MasterLabel or DeveloperName |
| SOQL on Quote `PricebookId`: "No such column" | Use `Pricebook2Id` |
| SOQL `SELECT DISTINCT`: "only aggregate expressions use field aliasing" | Use GROUP BY |
| create_record / bulk_create_records parameter errors | create_record takes objectName + values; bulk_create_records takes sobjectType + records |

## Pricebook Data Loading Order
Create the custom Pricebook2 (active), then insert PricebookEntry rows in the Standard Price Book first, then in the custom price book for the same products. A product must have a Standard Price Book entry before it can have a custom-book entry. Verify with a SOQL count on the custom book.

## Not Yet Validated in the Field Notes
Quote-enabled Account record type/layout, Visit Record Type Routing, FLS by profile, Product Catalog for LSC, Assortment/Store Assortment, PTA with Purpose = Quote, Price Adjustment Tiers for LS products, mobile cache regeneration, Store Check setup, and end-to-end rep validation were left undone (they need design decisions or UI).
