# Remote Engagement on Web (Twilio) - Winter '27 (264)

## What's New

Reps, MSLs, and KAMs can launch and conduct scheduled, Twilio-powered Remote Engagement sessions directly from Salesforce Web (previously mobile only). They can share approved content, track engagement, and collect remote signatures, with the same core Remote Player experience as mobile.

## Admin Setup & Configuration

No separate Remote Engagement configuration is required for Web. The existing Twilio setup, permissions, and supported capabilities from the mobile experience are reused.

One additional step: extend the existing Twilio Trusted URLs to cover **Lightning Experience Pages** in the CSP Context.

| Twilio Trusted URL | CSP Context | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `wss://global.vss.twilio.com` | Experience Builder Sites | Existing |
| `wss://sdkgw.us1.twilio.com` | Experience Builder Sites | Existing |
| `wss://global.vss.twilio.com` | Lightning Experience Pages | New - required for Web |
| `wss://sdkgw.us1.twilio.com` | Lightning Experience Pages | New - required for Web |

Steps:
1. Setup > Trusted URLs.
2. Create additional entries for both Twilio endpoints.
3. Set CSP Context to **Lightning Experience Pages**.
4. Set CSP Directive to **connect-src (scripts)**.
5. Ensure the URLs are active and save.

Keep the existing Experience Builder Sites entries so HCPs can still join remote sessions. Alternative: set the CSP Context of the existing Twilio Trusted URLs to **All** to cover both experiences without extra entries.

## End-User Flow (Web)

1. Create and schedule a Remote Visit from Salesforce Web; invitations are sent automatically.
2. From the Visit, select **Start Remote Engagement** (new).
3. The Remote Player opens directly in the browser (new).
4. During the session the rep can share approved content, request DTP / Sample signatures, and request Consent signatures.

Use case: a rep launches a planned remote visit from the browser, presents approved content, discusses it with the HCP, and captures a required signature in the same session.

## Limitations / Gotchas

Not available on Web (compared with mobile):
- Session recording
- Share via the rep's WhatsApp from the Remote Player
- Starting an ad-hoc Remote Engagement session (only scheduled Remote Visits)
