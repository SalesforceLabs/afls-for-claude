## How to Answer Product Management Questions

**Always call MCP tools to get sourced documentation.** Do not answer from general knowledge alone.

| User asks about... | Call this tool |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Product concepts, hierarchy, best practices | `get_afls_module_docs({ module: "product-management" })` |
| Specific product topic (restrictions, priorities, messages, etc.) | `search_afls_knowledge({ query: "<topic>" })` |
| Admin Console product settings | `list_admin_settings({ category: "ProductManagement" })` |
| Trigger handler status | `list_trigger_handlers()` |
| Object fields and relationships | `describe_sobject({ sobject: "LifeSciMarketableProduct" })` |
| Product data in the org | `run_soql({ query: "SELECT ... FROM LifeSciMarketableProduct ..." })` |
| Mobile cache status | `check_mobile_cache_status()` |
| Validation / audit | `audit_mobile_config({ group: "product-config-check" })` |

## Configuration Mode

When the user asks about configuring Product Management features, **ask them which mode they prefer**:

1. **Show me the documentation** — call `get_afls_module_docs({ module: "product-management" })` and present the relevant sections
2. **Walk me through it** — configure it directly in their org step-by-step (guided setup below)

Default to **guided setup** when connected to an org, or documentation mode if no org is connected.

### Guided Setup Workflow

#### Step 1: Check Current State
```
list_trigger_handlers()
list_admin_settings({ category: "ProductManagement" })
```

#### Step 2: Report Findings
Present a summary table of what's configured vs what's missing/disabled.

#### Step 3: Propose Changes
For each issue found, propose the fix and wait for user confirmation.

#### Step 4: Apply Changes (with user confirmation)
```
toggle_trigger_handler({ handlerName: "ProductManagementTriggerHandler", active: true })
update_admin_setting({ recordId: "...", fields: { ... } })
```

#### Step 5: Verify
Re-run the checks from Step 1 to confirm everything is configured correctly.

## Tool Usage Rules

### Correct Object Names
| Correct | Wrong (NEVER use) |
|---------|-------------------|
| `Product2` | `Product__c` |
| `LifeSciMarketableProduct` | `MarketableProduct__c`, `ProductHierarchy__c` |
| `ProductGuidance` | `ProductMessage__c`, `ProductObjective__c` |
| `LifeSciTerritoryProductPriority` | `ProductPriority__c`, `TerritoryProduct__c` |
| `LifeSciProductAccountRestriction` | `ProductRestriction__c`, `ProductAlignment__c` |
| `TerritoryProductQtyAllocation` | — |
| `ProductTerritoryAvailability` | `ProductAlignment__c` |
| `ProductTerrDtlAvailability` | — (read-only, created by alignment batch job only) |
| `ProductSpecificationType` | — |

### Tool Restrictions
- **DO NOT** use `run_soql` for Admin Console settings — use `list_admin_settings`
- **DO NOT** use `run_soql` for mobile cache — use `check_mobile_cache_status()`
- **DO NOT** suggest OmniStudio/FlexCard/OmniScript for mobile — NOT available on AFLS Mobile iPad app

### Product Territory Alignment Pipeline

`ProductTerritoryAvailability` (PTA) records link marketable products to territories. However, the platform actually reads from `ProductTerrDtlAvailability` (PTDA) — a read-only object that can **only** be created by the alignment batch job:

```
ProductTerritoryAvailability (PTA)     ← scriptable via Apex/API
        ↓ alignment batch job          ← Admin Console > Product (tile) > Product Alignment Jobs
ProductTerrDtlAvailability (PTDA)      ← read-only, cannot insert directly
```

**Key facts:**
- PTDAs are the master product pool for both Product Details and Samples panels
- After creating PTAs, the alignment batch job MUST run to generate PTDAs
- The batch job is NOT callable from anonymous Apex — it must be triggered from the Admin Console UI
- Brand-level and sample-level marketable products each need their own PTAs
- **PTAs must use `Territory and Subordinates Inclusion` at a parent territory** (e.g., `GB-COUNTRY`). Using `Territory Inclusion` at a leaf territory does NOT create PTDAs — the batch only generates PTDAs when expanding from parent to child.
- `SortOrder` on PTDA defaults to null — this does NOT block product display

### Brand vs Product Marketable Product Types

- `Type = 'Brand'` — appears in **Product Details** during visits. Requires `ProductId = null`.
- `Type = 'Product'` — appears in **Samples** panel. Requires `ProductId` pointing to a Product2 record, plus `ParentBrandProductId` pointing to a Brand marketable product, plus `DistributionMethod` set.
- In multi-country setups, country sub-brands (e.g., "Immunexis GB") need `Type = 'Brand'` for Product Details.
