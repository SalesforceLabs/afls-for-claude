## Critical Knowledge: How Samples Are Resolved During a Visit

When a rep opens the **Samples** panel during Visit Engagement, the platform runs ~12 SOQL queries. The critical ones are:

### The PTDA Requirement (Most Common Root Cause)

`ProductTerrDtlAvailability` (PTDA) records are the **master product pool** for samples. Without them, samples will never appear. PTDAs are:
- **Read-only** — cannot be inserted via Apex, API, or Data Loader
- **Created only** by the alignment batch job from `ProductTerritoryAvailability` (PTA) records
- The batch job must be triggered from **Admin Console > Product (tile) > Product Alignment Jobs**

### PTA → Batch Job → PTDA Pipeline

```
ProductTerritoryAvailability (PTA)     ← Apex-scriptable
        ↓ alignment batch job          ← Admin Console UI only
ProductTerrDtlAvailability (PTDA)      ← read-only, cannot insert
```

**Brand-level AND sample-level** marketable products each need their own PTAs. Step 4 in the data loading flow only creates PTAs for Brand-level products. Sample-level products need separate PTAs + a batch job run.

### Critical: AlignmentType Must Be "Territory and Subordinates Inclusion"

PTAs must use **`Territory and Subordinates Inclusion`** at a **parent territory** (e.g., `GB-COUNTRY`). The batch job generates PTDAs by expanding parent alignments down to child territories. Using `Territory Inclusion` directly at a leaf territory (e.g., `GB-FSR-001-London`) does **NOT** create PTDA records — this is the most common cause of "samples not appearing after running the batch job."

### Query #9 — The Critical Sample Filter

This is where most "No items found" issues originate:
```sql
SELECT Id FROM LifeSciMarketableProduct
WHERE IsCompetitorProduct != true
  AND Type IN ('Product')
  AND ParentBrandProductId IN (:brandIdsFromQuery6)
  AND DistributionMethod IN ('Drop','DropAndShip')
  AND ProductId IN (:product2IdsFromQuery8)
  AND ProductSpecificationType IN ('LSSampleProduct')
```

ALL conditions must pass:
- `Type = 'Product'` (not Brand) — sample-level marketable products required
- `ParentBrandProductId` must point to a Brand marketable product aligned to the territory
- `DistributionMethod` must be `Drop`, `Ship`, or `DropAndShip`
- `ProductId` must be in the rep's inventory (`ProductItem` records)
- `ProductSpecificationType = 'LSSampleProduct'` (auto-populated from Product2)

## Critical Knowledge: Sample Limit Setup

Sample limits control how many sample units a rep can drop per visit or per period for a given HCP account. Getting them to work on mobile requires several data records, correct JSON formats, sharing, and Admin Console settings — all aligned.

### Sample Limit Data Model

```
ProviderSampleLimitTemplate          ← Defines rules (PerVisitLimit, PerPeriodLimit)
    ↓
ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment        ← Links template → Brand marketable product (Private OWD!)
    ↓
ProviderSampleLimit                  ← Links template → Account × Brand product (contains Rule JSON)
    ↓
Mobile validation on submit          ← Checks qty against Rule JSON
```

### The #1 Rule: Limits Must Be at Brand Level

`ProviderSampleLimit.ProductId` and `ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment.ProductId` must point to **Brand-level** marketable products (Type = 'Brand'), NOT SKU-level (Type = 'Product').

The mobile app resolves limits by walking **up** the product hierarchy from the dropped SKU to find its parent Brand, then queries `ProviderSampleLimit` for that Brand × Account. If the PSL record points to a SKU, the hierarchy walk never finds it, and validation **silently skips**.

**How to verify:** Check `productType` in the `ProviderSampleLimit.Rule` JSON:
- `"Brand"` = correct
- `"LSSampleProduct"` = wrong (SKU-level), validation will not fire

### ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment Has Private OWD

This is the most common cause of "validation works on web but not mobile":
- **Web** runs server-side in system context — reads all records regardless of sharing
- **Mobile** syncs to local SQLite in **user context** — if the assignment isn't shared with the rep, it won't sync, and validation silently skips

**Fix:** Create `ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignmentShare` records for each assignment × rep user, or change OWD to Public Read Only.

### Sample Limit Setup Steps

1. Create a custom `ProviderSampleLimitTemplate` with valid date ranges (do NOT use the default `lsc4ce_GenericTemplate` — its dates are empty and cause null dereference)
2. Create `ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment` at **Brand level** with RuleCondition in map format
3. Share assignments with rep users (`ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignmentShare`)
4. Run "Assign Sample Limit Templates to Accounts" batch job from **Admin Console > Sample Limits (tile) > Sample Limit Jobs** — generates `ProviderSampleLimit` records with correct Rule JSON
5. Verify generated PSL records have `productType: "Brand"` in Rule JSON
6. Enable "Validate sample limits" in Admin Console > Visit Settings
7. Ensure all 3 DbSchema OMCC (`LifeSciConfigRecord`) entries exist and are active:
   - `DbSchema_ProviderSampleLimit`
   - `DbSchema_ProviderSampleLimitTemplate`
   - `DbSchema_ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment`

   **How to check:** Query via Tooling API (NOT SOQL — `LifeSciConfigRecord` is not queryable via standard SOQL):
   ```
   SELECT Id, DeveloperName, IsActive FROM LifeSciConfigRecord
   WHERE DeveloperName IN (
     'DbSchema_ProviderSampleLimit',
     'DbSchema_ProviderSampleLimitTemplate',
     'DbSchema_ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment'
   )
   ```

   **How to create missing entries:** Deploy as `LifeSciConfigRecord` metadata XML. Each file must include the full structure: `<fieldValues>` entries (especially `<fieldName>SObject</fieldName>` with `<objectValue>` set to the target object API name), profile `<assignments>`, and `<lifeSciConfigCategory>DbSchema</lifeSciConfigCategory>`.

   **Two-phase deployment required:** Deploy with `<isActive>false</isActive>` first, then redeploy with `<isActive>true</isActive>`. Deploying active in a single step fails with `Enter: [Type, SObject]`.

### Rule JSON Format

The `Rule` field on `ProviderSampleLimit` uses this structure (batch job generates it automatically):

```json
{
  "template": {
    "operations": [
      { "operation": "RULE", "rule": "PerVisitLimit" },
      { "operation": "RULE", "rule": "PerPeriodLimit" },
      { "operation": "AND" }
    ],
    "name": "lsc4ce_GenericTemplate",
    "blockType": "Error",
    "label": "Generic Template"
  },
  "products": {
    "<Brand MktProd Id>": {
      "rules": {
        "PerVisitLimit": {
          "quota": 2,
          "remaining": 2,
          "strategy": "SKU",
          "calculation": "SamplesPerVisit",
          "label": "Maximum Quantity per Visit",
          "starts": "2026-01-01",
          "ends": "2026-12-31",
          "period": { "type": "SampleLimitDateRangePeriod", "params": {} }
        },
        "PerPeriodLimit": {
          "quota": 10,
          "remaining": 10,
          "strategy": "SKU",
          "calculation": "SamplesInPeriod",
          "label": "Maximum Quantity per Period",
          "starts": "2026-01-01",
          "ends": "2026-12-31",
          "period": { "type": "SampleLimitDateRangePeriod", "params": {} }
        }
      },
      "info": {
        "productType": "Brand",
        "excludedChildProducts": [],
        "annualAllocations": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Key fields:
- `template.blockType`: `"Error"` blocks submission; `"Warning"` allows it
- `template.operations`: Boolean logic — `AND` means both rules must pass
- `products.<id>`: Key is the **Brand-level** marketable product ID
- `info.productType`: Must be `"Brand"` — `"LSSampleProduct"` means wrong level
- `info.excludedChildProducts`: Must be present (array of SKU IDs to exclude)
- `strategy: "SKU"`: Quotas tracked per SKU independently, but quota values are the same for all SKUs under the Brand
- `remaining`: Runtime counter decremented as drops are recorded
- `starts`/`ends`: Must cover the current date or validation won't apply

The `RuleCondition` on `ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment` uses a **different** map format keyed by rule name:

```json
{
  "PerPeriodLimit": {
    "name": "PerPeriodLimit",
    "label": "Maximum Quantity per Period",
    "strategy": "SKU",
    "quota": 10,
    "calculation": "SamplesInPeriod",
    "period": {
      "type": "SampleLimitDateRangePeriod",
      "params": { "starts": "2026-01-01", "ends": "2026-12-31" }
    }
  },
  "PerVisitLimit": {
    "name": "PerVisitLimit",
    "label": "Maximum Quantity per Visit",
    "strategy": "SKU",
    "quota": 2,
    "calculation": "SamplesPerVisit",
    "period": {
      "type": "SampleLimitDateRangePeriod",
      "params": { "starts": "2026-01-01", "ends": "2026-12-31" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Do NOT use array format** (`[{...}]`) for assignment RuleCondition — it must be the map/object format above.

### Template Name Must Be DeveloperName

`ProviderSampleLimit.PrvdSampleLmtTemplateName` must use the template's **DeveloperName** (e.g., `GB_Sample_Limit_Template`), not the MasterLabel. Wrong name = batch job returns 0 rows and hits null reference.

### SignatureRequirementLevel

Set `LifeSciMarketableProduct.SignatureRequirementLevel` to `Mandatory` on sample SKUs to require signature capture during sample drops. Values: `Mandatory`, `Optional`, `NotRequired`.

### Sample Limit Diagnostic Checklist

When limits don't fire on mobile:
- `ProviderSampleLimit.ProductId` → Brand-level marketable product?
- Rule JSON `productType` = `"Brand"` (not `"LSSampleProduct"`)?
- `ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment` shared with rep user?
- "Validate sample limits" enabled in Visit Settings?
- All 3 DbSchema OMCC entries exist and active? (Query via **Tooling API**, not SOQL: `SELECT Id, DeveloperName, IsActive FROM LifeSciConfigRecord WHERE DeveloperName IN ('DbSchema_ProviderSampleLimit', 'DbSchema_ProviderSampleLimitTemplate', 'DbSchema_ProviderSmplLmtTmplAssignment')`) — if any are missing, the mobile app won't sync the corresponding objects and validation silently skips
- Product hierarchy fully linked (`ParentTherapeuticAreaId` at all levels)?
- Rule JSON date ranges cover today?
- `PrvdSampleLmtTemplateName` uses DeveloperName?
- iPad synced after changes?

---

### SortOrder on PTDA Is NOT Required

`SortOrder` on `ProductTerrDtlAvailability` defaults to null. Query #2 filters by `SortOrder != null`, which often returns 0 rows. This does NOT block samples — the platform uses all PTDAs for the territory (queried by `TerritoryId`) regardless of `SortOrder`.

### Admin Console Navigation

- Product Alignment: **Admin Console > Product (tile) > Product Alignment**
- Alignment Jobs: **Admin Console > Product (tile) > Product Alignment Jobs**
- Sample Limit Jobs: **Admin Console > Sample Limits (tile) > Sample Limit Jobs**
- These are NOT under Salesforce Setup — they are tiles in the Admin Console app.

## How to Answer Sample Management Questions

**Always call MCP tools to get sourced documentation.** Do not answer from general knowledge alone.

| User asks about... | Call this tool |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Sample concepts, data setup chain, best practices | `get_afls_module_docs({ module: "sample-management" })` |
| Specific topic (sample limits, PDMA, inventory counts, etc.) | `search_afls_knowledge({ query: "<topic>" })` |
| Current org sample configuration | `check_sample_config()` |
| Admin Console sample settings | `list_admin_settings({ category: "SampleManagement" })` |
| Trigger handler status | `list_trigger_handlers()` |
| Object fields and relationships | `describe_sobject({ sobject: "ProductItem" })` or `describe_sobject({ sobject: "ProductDisbursement" })` |
| Mobile cache status | `check_mobile_cache_status()` |
| Inventory data in the org | `run_soql({ query: "SELECT ... FROM ProductItem ..." })` |
| Validation / audit | `audit_mobile_config({ group: "sample-config-check" })` |
| Sample drops during visits (test cases) | `search_afls_knowledge({ query: "sample inventory validation visit" })` |
| Sample limit setup or troubleshooting | `search_afls_knowledge({ query: "sample limit validation" })` |
| Sample limit not firing on mobile | Check: PSL at Brand level? Assignment shared? Visit Settings enabled? DbSchema active? |

## Configuration Mode

When the user asks about configuring or enabling Sample Management features, **ask them which mode they prefer**:

1. **Show me the documentation** — call `get_afls_module_docs({ module: "sample-management" })` and present the relevant sections
2. **Walk me through it** — configure it directly in their org step-by-step (guided setup below)

Default to **guided setup** when connected to an org, or documentation mode if no org is connected.

### Guided Setup Workflow

#### Step 1: Check Current State
```
check_sample_config()
list_trigger_handlers()
list_admin_settings({ category: "SampleManagement" })
```

#### Step 2: Report Findings
Present a summary table of what's configured vs what's missing/disabled.

#### Step 3: Propose Changes
For each issue found, propose the fix and wait for user confirmation.

#### Step 4: Apply Changes (with user confirmation)
```
toggle_trigger_handler({ handlerName: "SampleManagementTriggerHandler", active: true })
update_admin_setting({ recordId: "...", fields: { ... } })
create_admin_setting({ category: "SampleManagement", developerName: "...", label: "..." })
```

#### Step 5: Verify
Re-run `check_sample_config()` to confirm everything is configured correctly.
